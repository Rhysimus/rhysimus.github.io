                    <p>Being on committee has given me insight into how wonderful CSS is and how everything works. I want to take this further by taking on the role of Secretary - who supports the committee, organises and minutes the meetings and keeps up to date with communications.</p>

                    <p>I've been on the current committee as First Year Representative, which has taught me a lot about CSS and how to make it awesome for you. The society of course, not the language. The language scares me. Outside of that, I'm someone who always listens and is able to manage my time effectively. I've also had the pleasure to recently undertake the roles of Secretary, which I thank the current committee that gave me the chance to learn.</p>

I also want to embrace the warm nature of the society, and continue the legacy of awesome events and member engagement for you within the committee.</p>
